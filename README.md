# Numerics

Author : Matt Law

A personal C++ library, which currently contains the following files (of interest)

  bound     : a number that's bound between a minimum and a maximum (min <= num <= max)
  
  cyclic    : a number that cycles between a minimum and a maximum, so that min <= num <= max. 
  
  fraction  : elementary fraction, e.g. 5/3, stored as a numerator and a denominator. 
  
  number    : a normal number, that also keeps track of it's uncertainty and units (useful for science/engineering)
